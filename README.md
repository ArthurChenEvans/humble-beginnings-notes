# Humble Beginnings' Notes
Here we will host notes containing experiments, resources, and literature interpretations for all others to see.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **Course**
This folder will contain the learning content for the course. It will be the foundation of our **“Learning How to Learn”** course. The content will evolve as we continue gathering evidence and refining methods.
- **Basics**: Notes from books like *Make It Stick* and *A Mind For Numbers*. It includes the foundational concepts for learning strategies.
- **Advanced**: Future subfolders for more advanced learning methods once the basics are covered.

### 2. **Experiments**
This folder will hold all experiment-related content. Each subfolder will represent an individual contributor’s experiments, tracking different learning methods and their results.
- **[Contributor Name]**: Subfolder where contributors document their experiments, the methodologies used, and the outcomes.
  - *Example*: `Andy_Experiment_01` – A folder with notes on an experiment with spaced repetition for memory retention.

### 3. **Literature Interpretations**
This folder will compile synthesized interpretations of **multiple sources**. Rather than summarising a single book or article, this will focus on drawing connections and insights from various pieces of literature and experiments to understand overarching patterns and themes.
- **[Topic Name]**: Subfolders for different topics, where we synthesise insights across various sources related to that topic.
  - *Example*: `Optimizing_Spaced_Repetition` – A file interpreting findings from multiple articles, books, and experiments on  spaced repetition

### 4. **Resources**
This folder will store all the external resources we reference in the project. It will include categorized materials like books, articles, videos, and papers.
- **Books**: A subfolder for notes and references to key books.
- **Articles**: A subfolder for articles, blog posts, and online research.
- **Videos**: A subfolder for video resources that explain or demonstrate learning strategies.
- **Papers**: A subfolder for academic papers that we use to back up our learning methods and findings.

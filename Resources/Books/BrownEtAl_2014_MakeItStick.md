- A **mental model** is defined as a representation of an external reality such as the inner workings of an automotive engine. Brown et al use it here to refer to motor skills too known as **motor schemas**. (Ch1. P6)
- Rereading is time consuming, does not produce durable memories, and it gives a false sense of mastery via familiarity (Ch1. P10).

- "Learning is stronger when it matters, when the abstract becomes concrete and personal" (Ch1. P11)
- Pure repetition without retrieval is futile. Examples used on recalling details of a penny or where a fire extinguisher is located. Even with years of repetitive **exposure** (Ch1. P13).

- Finding out that repetition by itself was not enough for learning was from Endel Tulving (Ch1. P14).

- Rereading does not produce much benefit if at all. Also, students (up to the book being written in 2014), seem to choose it, highlighting, and underlying as the most common strategies. (Ch1. P14-15)

- Rereading gives illusion of fluency. This is where students fail to recognise what areas they are weak in, as well as overestimate their mastery and proficiency in a skill (Ch1. P16).

- Students in a middle school, Columbia, Illinois were put into two groups: 3 low stake quizzes (with feedback) over a semester and only 3 review sessions with no quizzes. Students who were quizzed averaged A-, while those who only reviewed averaged C+ (Ch1. P19).
